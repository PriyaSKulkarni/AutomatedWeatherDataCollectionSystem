🌤️ Exciting News from the World of Data Automation! 🌤️

🔹 **Project Overview:** I've successfully engineered an ETL Bash script for autonomous daily weather data collection in Casablanca using wttr.in. This system uses essential Linux tools such as curl, grep, cut, and xargs, demonstrating advanced Unix/Linux data manipulation skills.

🔹 **Purpose & Impact:** The primary goal was to automate the collection of critical temperature data, facilitating further analytical applications. This deployment enhances our ability to access reliable, timely weather data and underscores the practical utility of shell scripting.

🔹 **Skill Enhancement:** A special thanks to IBM's learning resources, which significantly boosted my data manipulation and scripting capabilities. The knowledge gained was crucial for the success of this project.

🔹 **Future Applications:** I am eager to apply this automated system to predictive weather modeling and other real-time data-dependent analytical tasks.

🔹 **Acknowledgments:** Thank you to everyone who supported this project and to the open-source community for the tools that made this possible.
